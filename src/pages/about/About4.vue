    <h2 class="hh">Legal status</h2>
    <p>
      Godot is financially supported by the <a href="#">Godot Foundation</a>, a
      non-profit organization formed on August 23rd, 2022 via the KVK (number
      87351919) in the Netherlands. The Godot Foundation is responsible for
      managing donations made to Godot and ensuring that such donations are used
      to enhance Godot. The Godot Foundation is a legally independent
      organization and does not own Godot. In the past, the Godot existed as a
      member project of the <a href="#">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large">
      Godot can't be sold or purchased by any company.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Godot Foundation holds assets on behalf of Godot including
      trademarks, contracts, and the bank account, the copyright to Godot's
      source is held collectively by every contributor.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the Godot Foundation is to financially support the growth,
      initiatives and activities of the Godot Engine project, an open-source
      project that provides a free suite of tools and educational materials
      around the Godot Engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Foundation strives to help Godot continue to break down barriers to
      video game development and make it possible for everyone to create high
      quality video games, regardless of who they are and where they are
      located.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">The Board of Directors</h2>
    <p>
      The Godot Foundation is led by the Board of Directors (formerly the
      Project Leadership Committee) who are responsible for making all funding
      and institutional decisions for Godot. The Board is made of the project
      founders (Ariel Manzur and Juan Linietsky) as well as trusted contributors
      and community members. As spaces open up on the board, current members may
      reach out to contributors and community members with a proven track record
      and deep understanding of the project and ask them to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Board must be made of a balance of contributors with technical
      expertise, and community members who bring the perspective of the
      community at large. The Board is subject to rules set by the Godot
      Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>The Board of Directors currently consists of the following members:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2"><p>Ariel Manzur — ariel@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Bastiaan Olij — bastiaan@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Clay John — clay@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>George Marques — george@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>HP van Braam — hp@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Ilaria Cislaghi — ilaria@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Juan Linietsky — juan@godotengine.org</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Julian Murgia — julian@godotengine.org</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hh">Advisors</h2>
    <p>
      The Board has enlisted the help of its most trusted and veteran
      contributors whom they call the advisors. The advisors are consulted on
      usage of funds as well as institutional matters. It is important to note,
      however, that while the advice of the advisory panel is weighed heavily,
      the final authority on these matters remains with the Board. In practice,
      the Board rarely makes an important decision without at least discussing
      it with the advisors first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the Board, contributors do not apply to become advisors. Instead the
      process of joining the advisors group is organic; trusted contributors may
      be asked to join after showing dedication, expertise, and leadership
      within the Godot community.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Funding decisions</h2>
    <p>
      All donations and sponsorships go directly to the Godot Foundation. The
      Board makes all decisions on how the funds are used, following rules
      established by the Foundation. These rules dictate that funding can only
      be used for the benefit of the project. Usage of funds generally includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2"><p>Hiring contributors</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Organizing events</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Reimbursements for traveling to events</p></li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>Purchasing hardware required for contributors to work on Godot</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At <a href="#">the end of each operating year</a> the Foundation publishes
      audited financial statements outlining funds received, and how such funds
      were used in that year. Financial reports take time to prepare and audit,
      as such they are not available immediately at year end. They are available
      on the Foundation's website as soon as feasible after they are prepared.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Technical decisions</h2>
    <p>
      Technical decisions are made by Area Owners and the project leaders. Godot
      has the following established roles:
    </p>
    <h3 class="hh">Leadership</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2"><p>Juan Linietsky — Technical and Project Lead</p></li>
      <li class="li2"><p>Rémi Verschelde — Project Manager</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The project leaders have final say on all code merges. In theory, this
      means the leaders will have the final say when maintainers cannot agree.
      In practice, this authority rarely needs to be invoked because decisions
      are made by maintainers in consultation with the community.
    </p>
    <h3 class="hh">Teams and area owners</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Engine teams</a> are groups of contributors interested in a
      specific area of the engine. Teams provide a way for contributors to have
      focused discussions with other people with similar expertise and
      interests. The opinion and expertise of team members is valued in
      discussions, but ultimately the authority over an area of the engine
      belongs solely to the area owner and the project leadership. Area owners
      are entrusted with final say for code merges in their areas. Area owners
      are trusted contributors who are chosen by the project leadership and have
      shown knowledge of the specific area of the engine and the engine's
      philosophy as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, area owners aim for consensus among contributors, especially
      among the relevant team. The "rule of thumb" is to not merge code if
      significant disputes exist over a change. However the final decision still
      remains with the area owner. The Godot project strives for rich, public,
      technical discussions where anyone can contribute and agree on the way to
      move forward. Additionally, the leadership and area owners consult with
      other contributors and the community as much as possible every time new
      features and improvements are planned.
    </p>
    <h3 class="hh">Community</h3>
    <p>
      We strive to make our relationship with the community as symbiotic as
      possible within the limits of feasibility.
      <a href="#">The Godot community</a> is made up of users, contributors,
      maintainers, and project leadership. Godot exists because its community
      trusts the work we do, so we try to entrust the community with deciding
      the general direction of the project as much and as openly as possible.
      This is how we see the process as community-driven:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: larger">Open development:</span> All
          development (code that makes it into the engine, docs, website, etc)
          is made via Pull Requests. They are open for anyone to see, review and
          comment on. From the leadership to the new contributors, everyone is
          required to create them in order for their work to be included.
          <a href="#">Pull Requests</a> are approved and merged by the
          respective area maintainers while, again, always striving to promote
          agreement before moving forward. All improvements to the engine are
          made through the Pull Requests of community members.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: larger">Open discussion:</span> Before doing
          any significant amount of work, we encourage maintainers,
          contributors, and community to open and discuss features and proposals
          in the Godot proposals repository. This allows all contributors to
          have a much better understanding of how users expect the new feature
          to be used. Because the primary aim of Godot is to produce a useful
          tool, we ask those who open proposals to discuss real-world use cases
          based on problems they are having with their current projects. This
          allows maintainers and contributors to have a much more "down to
          earth" understanding of user's requirements. This philosophy is best
          explained in the engine contributor guidelines.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: larger">Community-minded:</span>The Godot
          project is developed by and for the community. No corporate entity
          exists behind Godot that prioritizes one feature over another.
          Priorities are set by project leadership and area maintainers based on
          the feedback of the community in bug reports, proposals, and
          discussions in the various community channels. Ultimately, it is the
          community that determines the direction of the project.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every improvement to the engine, whether it is a feature or bug fix, is
      driven forward by Godot's community of contributors, users, maintainers,
      and leadership. Godot wouldn't exist in its current form without the
      countless contributions it receives from community members every day.
