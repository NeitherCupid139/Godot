    <p>
      Godot Engine is <a href="#">free and open source software</a> released
      under the permissive <a href="#">MIT license</a> (also named Expat
      license).
    </p>
    <p>This license grants users a number of freedoms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>You are free to use Godot Engine, for any purpose</p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>You can study how Godot Engine works and change it</p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Godot Engine,
          even commercially and under a different license (including
          proprietary)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Godot Engine, even
      commercially and under a different license (including proprietary)
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Your game</h2>
    <p>
      Godot Engine's license terms and copyright do not apply to the content you
      create with it; you are free to license your games how you see best fit,
      and will be their sole copyright owner(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note however that the Godot Engine binary that you would distribute with
      your game is a copy of the "Software" as defined in the license, and you
      are therefore required to include the copyright notice and license
      statement somewhere in your documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Godot Engine developers consider that a link to this page (<a href="#"
        >godotengine.org/license</a
      >) in your game documentation or credits would be an acceptable way to
      satisfy the license terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      See Complying with Licenses in the documentation for more information.
