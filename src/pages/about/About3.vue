    <h2 class="hh">Scope of This Notice</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Statement is intended to describe Godot Engine's privacy
      practices and provide information about the choices you have regarding the
      ways in which information collected by Godot Engine is used and disclosed.
      Godot Engine is referred to in this document as "Godot".
    </p>
    <p>
      It covers both online platforms of the Godot project and the use of the
      Godot Engine application.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to Godot. To better protect your privacy and to
      comply with various laws and regulations, we have provided this Statement
      explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about
      the way your personal information is collected, used and disclosed. To
      make this Statement easy to find, we have made it available on our
      homepage and at many of the locations where personally-identifiable
      information may be requested.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">The Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Statement applies to all information collected by or
      submitted to Godot, including personal data. "Personal data" is data that
      can be used to identify an individual.
    </p>
    <p>Godot collects personal data when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you visit the Godot web site (godotengine.org), hosted by TuxFamily
          (see the TuxFamily privacy policy:
          <a href="#">https://faq.tuxfamily.org/Privacy/En</a>);
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you access the Asset Library in the Godot editor application to browse
          or download assets;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you sign up as a Godot Patreon (<a href="#"
            >https://patreon.com/godotengine</a
          >) or otherwise donate to Godot (<a href="#"
            >https://godotengine.org/donate</a
          >);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you sign up and log in to an account on Godot's Q&A site (<a href="#"
            >https://ask.godotengine.org/</a
          >), and use it to ask or answer questions;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you sign up and log in to an account on Godot's Asset Library (<a
            href="#"
            >https://godotengine.org/asset-library</a
          >), and use it to submit content;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          you use one of Godot's publicly logged project IRC channels
          (#godotengine-atelier, #godotengine-devel, #godotengine-meeting) on
          the Libera Chat IRC network;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you use the Asset Library in the Godot Engine application, HTTPS
      requests are made to the Asset Library website, and may contain: Godot
      Engine version, search query, selected assets, and user IP. The Asset
      Library processes this data without storing it, but our TuxFamily
      hosting's HTTP server may log these requests. Such logs are subject to
      TuxFamily's privacy policy (https://faq.tuxfamily.org/Privacy/En). This is
      the only personal data collected by the Godot Engine application.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create an account on the Godot website (including the Godot Chat
      platform, the Q&A platform, the Asset Library and October CMS), it
      collects your username and email address for authentication. Additional
      information may be collected if you choose to fill in optional fields in
      your user profile (e.g. full name, location, profile picture).
    </p>
    <p>
      When you join or send messages to any of the IRC channels listed above,
      that activity is logged and published publicly for others interested in
      the project. This logging includes the user nickname specified when
      connecting to Libera Chat and your messages in those public channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anonymized site visit statistics (<a href="#"
        >https://stats.tuxfamily.org/godotengine.org</a
      >) and download statistics (<a href="#"
        >https://stats.download.tuxfamily.org/godotengine</a
      >) are collected and published publicly by our TuxFamily hosting.
    </p>
    <p>

      at conventions, trade shows and expositions. The types of personal data

      website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services,
      Godot uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A
      cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web
      server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of
      godotengine.org where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable
      require your browser to accept cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your
      account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better
      and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or
      "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.

    <p>
      If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you

      you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that
      the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and

    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Godot trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes
      our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses Secure
      Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you
      send your personal information on our website. In addition, Godot and its
      partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and
      precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your
      personal data.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Public Forums Reminder</h2>
    <p>
      Godot often makes mailing lists, source repositories, issue trackers,
      Etherpads, forums, and IRC logs available to the public. Please remember
      that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
      information. Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity
      before you disclose personal information. Although we value individual
      ideas and encourage free expression, Godot reserves the right to take
      necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as
      removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in Godot’s
      legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate record of
      data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to
      maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical,
      scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the
      free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and
      propagation of software freedom.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Out of special concern for children's privacy, Godot does not knowingly
      accept online personal information from children under the age of 13.
      Godot does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become
      registered members of our sites. Godot does not knowingly collect or
      solicit personal information about children under 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that Godot ever decides to expand its intended site audience
      to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in
      accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy
      Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit
      privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Godot will
      provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow
      parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their
      children's personal information, and provide access to any other
      information as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, EU residents under the age of 16 should not submit their
      personal data for subscribing to our email solicitations and we will
      delete any such data if we become aware of it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">About Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      This site contains links to other sites. Godot does not control the
      information collection of sites that can be reached through links from

      procedures of linked sites, please contact those sites directly.
