      The Godot project is an international community open to everyone without
      discrimination. We want this community to be a safe and welcoming place
      for both newcomers and current members. Everyone should feel comfortable
      and accepted regardless of their personal background and affiliation to
      the Godot project.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      In the Godot community, participants from all over the world come together
      to create a Free and Open Source game engine. This is made possible by the
      support, hard work, and enthusiasm of thousands of people who collaborate
      towards the common goal of creating great technology and games.
      Cooperation at such a scale requires common guidelines to ensure a
      positive and inspiring atmosphere in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of
      community we want to have. The rules below are not applied to all
      interactions with a simple matching algorithm. Human interactions happen
      in context and are complex. Perceived violations are evaluated by real
      humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with
      kindness. Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules
      would affect normal interactions. Be reasonable,
      <a href="#">the Code of Conduct team</a> surely will be as well.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Application</h2>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies to all users and contributors who engage with
      the Godot project and its community platforms, both online and at
      Godot-related events.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hh">Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>Politeness is expected at all times. Be kind and courteous.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          Always assume positive intent from others. Be aware that differences
          in culture and English proficiency make written communication more
          difficult than face-to-face communication and that your interpretation
          of messages may not be the one the author intended. Conversely, if
          someone asks you to rephrase something you said, be ready to do so
          without feeling judged.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          Feedback is always welcome but keep your criticism constructive. We
          encourage you to open discussions, proposals, issues, and bug reports.
          Use the community platforms to discuss improvements, not to vent out
          frustration. Similarly, when other users offer you feedback please
          accept it gracefully.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hh">Restricted conduct</h2>
    <P
      >Participating in restricted conduct will lead to a warning from community
      moderators and/or the Code of Conduct team and may lead to exclusion from
      the community in the form of a ban from one or all platforms.</P

          The Godot project is committed to providing a friendly and safe
          environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender
          identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
          appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, language proficiency, age,
          political orientation, nationality, religion, or other similar
          characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of
          participants in any form.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          In particular, we strive to be welcoming to all industry minorities
          and to ensure that they can take a more active role in the community
          and the project. Targeted harassment of minorities is unacceptable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          As a community developed project, we strive for consensus among
          contributors before moving forward with a proposed feature. If there
          is not enough support for your ideas, please don't continue insisting
          or trying to force others into supporting your point. Features are not
          accepted through a voting process, so piling onto a contentious
          feature proposal is not acceptable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>Aggressive or offensive behavior is not acceptable.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          You will be excluded from participating in the community if you
          insult, demean, harass, intentionally make others uncomfortable by any
          means, or participate in any other hateful conduct, either publicly or
          privately.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other
          attention-stealing behavior is not welcome and will result in
          exclusion from the community.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          Any form of retaliation against a participant who contacts the Code of
          Conduct team is completely unacceptable, regardless of the outcome of
          the complaint. Any such behavior will result in exclusion from the
          community.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="li2">
        <p>
          For certainty, any conduct which could reasonably be considered
          inappropriate in a professional setting is not acceptable.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hh">Reporting a breach</h2>
    <p>
      If you witness or are involved in an interaction with another community
      member that you think may violate this <a href="#">Code of Conduct</a>,
      please contact Godot's Code of Conduct team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Godot team recognizes that it can be difficult to come forward in
      cases of a violation of the Code of Conduct. To make it easier to report
      violations, we provide a single point of contact via email at:
      <a href="#">conduct@godotengine.org</a>. If you are more comfortable
      reaching out to a single person, you are also welcome to contact one or
      more members of the team using their personal emails listed below, or via
      direct messaging on community platforms where they are present.
